# FFXIV-Crafting-Trigger
This trigger monitors medicine, well-fed buff, and give a signal when it's close to finish. 

## About this trigger
This trigger reads or calculates the CP, durability, quality and progress when crafting. However, it cannot read the conditions of crafting. 
Currently, the trigger calculates 'Durability' wrongly from time to time. So sometimes a wrong signal can be sent. I suggest users view the result as some side help and check it manually every time. 

## For users
Download the .xml file and import to the triggernometry plugin in ACT. You need to change your name to your game ID in the triggers to make it work. And this only works for an English version FFXIV.
